<!-- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
Your application should use Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js.
├── __tests__/             //jest tests
│   ├── Employee.test.js
│   ├── Engineer.test.js
│   ├── Intern.test.js
│   └── Manager.test.js
├── dist/                  // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet      
├── lib/                   // classes
├── src/                   // template helper code 
├── .gitignore             // indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js               // runs the application
└── package.json           

Important: Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
The application must include Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass.
The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:


name
id
email
getName()
getId()
getEmail()
getRole()—returns 'Employee'
The other three classes will extend Employee.
In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have the following:
officeNumber
getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'
In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have the following:
github—GitHub username
getGithub()
getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'
In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:
school
getSchool()
getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'
Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format. -->
